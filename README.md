# Automatic-Text-Summarizer-using-NLTK
A methodology for producing short and exact summaries for large text documents is proposed. Recently, the size of data on the web is expanding . It has become difficult for users to dive into heaps of data to examine it and come to conclusions. This problem is solved by Text summarization by producing a summary that selects sentences which have the highest importance from the text document without losing any important data. In this project , a model for Extractive Text Summarization is implemented and designed for text document summarizations. It uses Natural Language Processing to choose the important sentences from the text document while still keeping the sentences in the summary meaningful and without loss. Natural Language Processing is done using the nltk toolkit available for Python.
The documents that are taken for summarization are in English language. Different word level and sentence level features are used to form meaningful sentences. The results show that the model used overcomes the issue of text overloading by producing an effective summary.
